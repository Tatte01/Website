In JS VisitorCounter

I use document.getElementById("visit-count) (Code line 3)

document is what you use to look through an HTML page.
So the counterE1 stores the <span> object.

For testing only i wanted to for my local Befdore i puch it up (Code line 7)

window.location.href returns the href (URL) of the current page

Then i use .includes(localhost) becuse this indicates that its on a local computer.
i personaly use "Live Server" while running tests so the URL i get is
localhost:5500/index.html.


(code line 14)
